Hello! I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Geography/Remote Sensing at San Diego State University and UC Santa Barbara. In addition to contributing to Earth and planetary science research, my long-term professional goals include inspiring and mentoring students through their early career research.

My educational background, M.S. Geology and B.S. Geology/Geophysics, stems from a STEM curiosity spark ignited in community college through the NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars Program and further through my undergrad university's program for developing early career researchers.

I'm currently interning as a NASA Education Resource Specialist for NASA's Climate Change Research Initiative, exploring innovative approaches to integrating NASAâ€™s Earth and climate science into the classroom. Thrrough this effort, I build relationships with educators to encourage their STEM identities and impact their authentic STEM experiences in their classrooms.
