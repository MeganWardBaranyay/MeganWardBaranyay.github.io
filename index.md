Hello! I am a first year Ph.D. student with a research focus on multi-sensor wildland fire remote sensing at San Diego State University and UC Santa Barbara. 

My research leverages pre-fire, active fire, and post-fire data collected during prescribed fires at Sedgwick Reserve in Santa Barbara County, California through the <a href="https://cce.nasa.gov/firesense/" target="_blank">**NASA FireSense Project**</a>, including airborne imaging spectroscopy, UAV LiDAR, in situ fire temperature, and UAVSAR. 

I'm an advocate for STEM education accessibility, early career research programs, and science communication. In summer, I serve as the student mentor for the terrestrial ecology research group in the <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth-science/early-career-opportunities/student-airborne-research-program/" target="_blank">**Student Airborne Research Program**</a>. Previously I served as the NASA Education Resource Specialist for <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/edu/ccri/" target="_blank">**NASA's Climate Change Research Initiative**</a>, exploring innovative approaches to integrating NASAâ€™s Earth and climate science into the classroom, and I continue to be active in CCRI's Education Ambassador Program. These opportunities are important to me, as my path to science started in community college with the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/nasa-community-college-aerospace-scholars/" target="_blank">**NASA Community College Aerospace Scholars Program**</a>.
